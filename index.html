              Why I'm here <br><br>
              Welcome to my domain. My name is Robert. I am married to a beatiful woman and we have two even more beatiful children.
              We met on Padre Island. I had a place near the bar where we met. Fairy tales are made in seedy bars. Fast forward, we lived in east Kentucky, 
              Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and here in East Texas. <br><br>
              I served a contract in the US Army, stationed in Germany and deployed to Iraq. I was a 63D (Self Propelled Field Artillery Systems Mechanic).
              Being an arty mechanic allowed me to pick my duty station. Germany was a clear choice. I was born and raised there until nearly 9 years old. So going 
              back was always somethign I wished for. So thanks Uncle Sam.<br><br>
              I moved back to Corpus Christi after I discharged from the Army. I met my wife in that coastal town. We lived in the afformentioned places. I spent time 
              as a heavy equipment mechanic. A career that pays well, but exacts a toll on the body. So I went to scool and earned an Associates Of Applied Science in Welding
              Technology and became a pipe welder. But the same issues plagued me. 6-7 day work weeks, 10-12 hour days, and there was never 
              enough ib profen. I had to think of another career. My brother and one of my cousin are full stack developers. They have spent 
              years trying to convince me to come over to the light. <br><br>
              This was the year I took their advice. I enrolled in the UTSA developer bootcamp to get a foot in the industry. This class is a tremendous step forward. 
              In fact, this is my first real website. I hope you enjoyed a little about me and I hope you enjoy the website.
